    ccp1.c

  @Summary
    This is the generated driver implementation file for the CCP1 driver using MPLAB� Code Configurator

  @Description
    This header file provides implementations for driver APIs for CCP1.
    Generation Information :
        Product Revision  :  MPLAB� Code Configurator - v2.10.3
        Device            :  PIC16F1709
        Driver Version    :  2.00
    The generated drivers are tested against the following:
        Compiler          :  XC8 v1.34
        MPLAB             :  MPLAB X 2.26

  @Summary
    Initializes the CCP1

  @Description
    This routine initializes the CCP1_Initialize
    This routine must be called before any other CCP1 routine is called.
    This routine should only be called once during system initialization.

    None

  @Returns
    None

  @Comment
    Used to generate delays of desired duration (us)

    <code>
    uint16_t compare;

    CCP1_Initialize();
    CCP1_SetCount(compare);

  @Summary
    Loads 16-bit compare value.

  @Description
    This routine loads the 16 bit compare value.

  @Preconditions
    CCP1_Initialize() function should have been
    called before calling this function.

  @Param
    Pass in 16bit compare value

  @Returns
    None

  @Example

/**
  @Summary
    Determines the completion of the data captured.

  @Description
    This routine is used to determine if data capture is completed.
    When data capture is complete routine returns 1. It returns 0 otherwise.

  @Preconditions
    CCP1_Initialize()function should have been called before calling this function.

  @Returns
   true - Indicates compare is complete
   false - Indicates compare is not complete

  @Param
    None

  @Example
    <code>
    uint16_t capture;

    CCP1_Initialize();
    CCP1_SetCount(compare);
    while(!CCP1_IsCompareComplete());
    </code>
